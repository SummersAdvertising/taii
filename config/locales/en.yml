    main_product_cate_1_content: "<br>
                The 2.6mm shaft bare copper wire is produced by the most advanced equipment from Europe and the double-head wiredrawing machine with non-limited slip differential and driven by the single motor. The advantages of the 2.6mm bare copper wire spool are listed as follows.<br>
                1. With smooth surface, it is suitable for enameled wire customers <br>
                   with high requirements on appearance.<br>
                2. It is so stretchable that it can be wire drawn to the ultra-<br>
                   fine copper wire with a diameter below 0.04mm.<br>
                3. It has been stretched and annealed continuously. The wire <br>
                   with a diameter of 2.6mm has the elongation above 32%. It is <br>
                   highly flexible and suitable for the processing of copper products.<br>"

                1. Feature: The surge resistance of the paint film can prevent the<br>
                   overload voltage generated during the high-speed adjustment of <br>
                   the frequency converter. Local discharges may occur and the film<br>
                   cracks due to heat deterioration. The resistance of the paint<br>
                   film under high temperature, pressure and frequency is better <br>
                   than that of the heat-resistant wire with the same level.<br>
                2. Use: The enameled wire is used as the coil winding material <br>
                   of the high-frequency transformer, inverter-driven motor<br>

The overall performance is better than general products by more than 30%. It is especially suitable for the compressors of high fill-in ratio, high performance and low energy consumption.
<br>
For the super-thin film covered enameled wire, 6μ film thickness ensures that the number of needle holes is controlled below 3 and the outer diameter is controlled within 2μ. The low GAS wire is not only demanding in the type of the varnish film and the lubricant on the surface. It has excellent slip performance to ensure the customer that the wire will not break during the high-speed winding process. The 2.0 wire and 180℃ solderable self-bonding wire can meet the special requirements of the customer. No products of any third parties can be used as a substitute thanks to the unique quality requirements of the wires. The technical development is striding toward HF resistant wires, Litz wires and other conductor enameled wires.</p>"

Employees can express their opinions through the \"company mailbox\", \"monthly HR meeting\" and \"mailbox for sexual harassment complaints\". Moreover, labor meetings are held periodically to ensure an open and free communication channel.</p>
    <p><b>Employee Training and Career Development</b><br>
